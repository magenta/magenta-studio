This repo is where the code to Magenta Studio is maintained. For information, support and installation instructions of the tools themselves go to [this website](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/studio/)

This is not a Google product. 

## Overview and Organization

The Magenta Studio plugins are Electron apps. Electron has the advantage of being a cross platform solution that works well with [magenta.js](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta-js). The code for each of the plugins is located in a folder with the same name. 

All of the plugins share common UI and communication components which can be found in the 'components' folder. These objects are built using [Polymer's LitElement](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element). 

The Ableton integration is achieved through [Max4Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/max-for-live/). The object and related javascript files can be found in the folder called 'magenta4live.amxd'. The Max component and the Electron apps communication over a local server running on port 3333. 

## Installation

If you have node.js and npm installed on your computer, all of the dependencies can be installed by running 

```
npm install
```

## Building

The modules come as both standalone apps and Ableton integrated. To build all versions (Linux standalone and Mac, Windows in standalone and Max For Live formats) run:

```
npm run build
```

All of the build files will be put into the 'dist' folder.

You can also build a specific target by passing it as an argument:

```
npm run build macos-standalone
```

The current options are:

* windows-ableton
* windows-standalone
* linux-standalone
* macos-ableton
* macos-standalone

*Note:* if you want to build Windows versions from Mac, you need to have [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) installed.
